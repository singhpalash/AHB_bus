AHB-Lite Slave in Verilog
This project implements a fully functional AHB-Lite slave interface written in Verilog. It's designed to help you understand how AHB-Lite peripherals work, especially in terms of how transactions (read/write) are handled at the slave side. The module supports configurable latency via wait states and includes basic error handling for invalid address accesses.
